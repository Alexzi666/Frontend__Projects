            <li>The ZGMF-X56S Impulse Gundam is a mobile suit introduced in the Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny television series. It was initially piloted by Shinn Asuka, and later by Lunamaria Hawke.</li>
            <li>ZGMF-X56S Impulse Gundam is a prototype general purpose mobile suit developed by ZAFT as part of their Second Stage Series. Unlike other units in the series, the Impulse Gundam is not designed for combat in a specific environment, instead it is designed to adapt to different combat situations by using back-mounted optional equipment packs known as Silhouette packs.</li>
            <li>The Impulse Gundam is also unique in that it is made up of three different modules. The main module is the small transformable fighter plane, the YFX-M56S Core Splendor which contains the suit's cockpit. The other modules are the Leg Flyer and Chest Flyer, and they can be easily replaced if damaged or destroyed, enabling the suit to stay in combat longer. The Impulse Gundam is in its modular form when on standby or undergoing maintenance. As such, it can only be stored and launched from the battleship Minerva which has a specialized hangar and catapult designed for the suit. The three modules will combine in mid-air after launch and then the Impulse Gundam will receive the Silhouette pack from the Silhouette Flyer.</li>
